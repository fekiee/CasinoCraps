The following code simulates the Casion Craps game.
It is "procedural" and incomplete.
Casino Craps (Basic Game) explanation:
The game of “craps” is commonly played in Casino’s. 

Generally, the game works as follows:
A player rolls two dice (each with 6 possible values, 1 – 6). After rolling the two dice, 
the sum of the scores are added. If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins. 

If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 on the first throw – it is called “craps” and the player loses. 

If the sum is any of the remaining values (4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10) this is called the players 
“point” (or "point-value"). 

Rolling a point-value gives the player a chance to roll again. They can win the game if they roll 
their point-value; however, if they roll a 7 first (i.e. before rolling their “point”) they lose. 

The player can keep rolling until they roll their “point” (in which case they win), or they 
roll a 7 (in which case they loose).

IMPORTANT: I hold no liability for any losses incurred should you choose to gamble real money 
in any way.  I highly recommend that you do NOT gamble real money, in any way, as you will most 
likely lose it.
